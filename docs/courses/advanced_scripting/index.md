# Advanced scripting with Fiji

In this course, we will introduce the fundamentals of scripting in Fiji. In the
first two days, we will cover introductory topics in programming such as
variables, logic, and control flow, and then use this programming knowledge to
create Fiji macros to automate processing of data. Some topics that we will
cover are batch processing files, making simple graphical user interfaces,
segmentation using pixel classification, and using the ROI manager in a script.
The third day will be a workshop-style event where participants are encouraged
to bring their own data and develop their own image analysis script. This
course is targeted toward people who have either already taken the HT
“introduction to scientific image analysis” course, or who have a good
background in ImageJ/Fiji.

!!!Note
    As with any programming language it is more important to understand the
    logic and the vocabulary than to know everything by heart. First and
    foremost, know where to find answers:
